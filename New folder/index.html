        <p>
          Currently working on an interactive informational website of a "To scale" version of the solar system . I initially drew inspiration from </p>
          <a href="https://atelier.net/virtual-economy/" target = _blank id="linkInspo">L'Atelier's || The Virtual Economy</a>
          <p> I found that I could 
          use the idea to map out a free camera solar system using Vite.JS and Three.JS.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>McDonalds</h3>
        
        <p>
          Worked full time during the last 5 months of my senior year at high school and vowed to never return. 
          Working 40+ hours a week at McDonalds taught me that I have no problem working hard and doing what I have to do. 
          It also showed me that throughout even the most stressful times, I can easily keep my composure and thought and
          work just as good and even better. This gave me a new perspective about myself. If I 
          can work at a McDonalds in a busy area where the stress in my surroundings is at an all time high for the majority
          of the day, then I can easily put that time to better use, put that same amount 
          of effort and work and concentration into something which I enjoy and which can take my life way past anything 
          I've ever dreamed. I enjoy coding and I enjoy watching lines of letters and numbers become alive.
